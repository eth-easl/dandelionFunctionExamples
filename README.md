## Overview

This repository contains examples of how to write functions to run on [Dandelion](https://github.com/eth-easl/dandelion)

The different folders contain examples and more information for the supported languages.

Curretly we only have full support for C and C++.
Examples for how to write functions, setup builds and other details can be found in the `c_functons` folder.

There is also support for functions compiled to Wasm.
The tooling to compile functions this way is in the `wasm-compiler` folder.
